1) BLSA0317.mat - this has 49 subjects, each of which has a (binary) gender.  for each subject, we have a 70x70 undirected weighted adjacency matrix, meaning there are nchoosek(70,2)=2415 dimensions.  x is currently stored in a 70x70x49 array, where each Aweighted(:,:,j) is upper triangular.  y is stored in a 49-dimensional vector called ClassIDs.  so, i think simply concatenating the upper triangular part of the adjacency matrix will yield useful features.  fwiw - i can classify these graphs already using a variety of techniques, and i achieve a leave-one-out cross-validated misclassification rate of 0.14, for pretty much anything.  so, i'd be (pleasantly) surprised if you can beat that! the matrix that stores the 

2) mrn_data_0915_rev3.mat - this one has the continuous variables too.  basically, it is the same deal. the array storing x is called Acount, it is 70x70x109.  the array storing a multidimensional y is called "covars".  the first column, which corresponds to CCI (a measure of creativity), we have demonstrated is significantly correlated with a clustering of these brain-graphs, so i would first try to regress on that.  we haven't yet found much from the other covariates, although if we can using this technique, that would be really exciting.


one thing of note, it might be important to normalize the values of the x's per subject, for example, so that they all have the same mean or range or something.  it might not be necessary, but if you don't get good results at first, that would be the first thing i'd try.
